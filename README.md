# Economic-Models

This repository contains a collection of Python implementations of key economic models and theories.  
It is intended as a learning and experimentation space for applying mathematical modeling and simulation techniques to economics.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Market Demand and Supply Model.py**  
  Simulates market equilibrium under different supply and demand conditions.

- **Optimization and Consumer Theory.py**  
  Implements utility maximization and budget constraints to illustrate consumer choice theory.

- **SIR Model with od Matrix.py**  
  Epidemiological SIR model with an origin-destination matrix to simulate population movement effects.

- **Stable SIR Model.py**  
  Variation of the SIR model focusing on system stability and steady-state analysis.

- **Solow Model.py**  
  Classical Solow growth model to study long-term economic growth and capital accumulation.

- **dating sort.py**  
  A small sorting algorithm experiment applied to a toy "dating market" dataset.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`

## üéØ Purpose
This repository was developed to deepen my understanding of economic modeling by translating theory into executable simulations.  
It can serve as a reference for students or researchers interested in computational economics.

## üöÄ How to Run
Clone the repository and run any model file directly:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Economic-Models.git
cd Economic-Models
python "Solow Model.py"
